title: My Story
---

My name is Ying Fang. I grew up in Wuhu, China, and have spent the last 10ish years in the United States. I am currently a postdoc at Northern Arizona University. This website is for sharing my academic and personal experiences including:

- Research in Biomechanics, engineering, and health science
- Thoughts on being in academia
- Freetime passion: rock climbing!


### Research

My research aims to understand and modify how people move to improve performance, prevent injuries, and live an active and happy life.

This applies to those with disabilities, elderly population, athletes, and sometimes myself!

### Academic Life

I had a pretty winding path throughout my education/academic career.

Starting with a bacheler's degree in Kinesiology at Shanghai University of Sport. I continued pursuing a master's degree with more focus on Biomechanics at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://krss.utk.edu/centers-labs/biomechanics-laboratory/){target="_blank"}. During my master's, my interests shifted towards the engineering side and that drove me to get a PhD in biomedical engineering at [WPI Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Lab](https://wp.wpi.edu/MBL/){target="_blank"}.

I have been working in the [NAU Biomechatronics Lab](https://biomech.nau.edu/){target="_blank"} since 2019. As a postdoc, I have attempted several NIH grants and am recently awarded the [F32 Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/fellowships/F32){target="_blank"}.

Being a professor/scientist was my top career choice at a very young age. I'm a little surprised and glad that this hasn't changed after all these years. Despite moments of self-doubt, it's been a fun ride so far.



### Rock Climbing
For me, rock climbing is an element that balances the(sometimes overwhelming) academic life, a way to know myself and push limits, and a medium to connect with nature and friends.

I like to follow the latest research and apply them to improve my own climbing. Thinking about combining my passion for biomechanics AND climbing, I hope to be the one who can offer knowledge to help other climbers!
