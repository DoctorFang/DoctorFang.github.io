My name is Ying Fang. I grew up in Wuhu, China, and have spent the last 10ish years in the United States. I am currently a postdoc at Northern Arizona University. This website is for sharing my academic and personal experiences, which include:

- Research in Biomechanics, engineering, and health science
- Thoughts on being in academia
- Part-time passion: rock climbing!


### Research

My research aims to understand and modify how people move to improve performance and prevent injuries. This applies to the ones with disabilities, elderly population, athletes, and sometimes myself!
