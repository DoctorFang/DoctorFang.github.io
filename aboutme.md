title: My Story
---

My name is Ying Fang. I grew up in Wuhu, China, and have spent the last 10ish years in the United States. I am currently a postdoc at Northern Arizona University. This website is for sharing my academic and personal experiences including:

- Research in Biomechanics, engineering, and health science
- Thoughts on being in academia
- Part-time passion: rock climbing!


### Research

My research aims to understand and modify how people move to improve performance and prevent injuries. This applies to the ones with disabilities, elderly population, athletes, and sometimes myself!

### Academic Life

I had a pretty winding path throughout my education/academic career.

Starting with a bacheler's degree in Kinesiology at Shanghai University of Sport. I continued pursuing a master's degree with more focus on Biomechanics at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://krss.utk.edu/centers-labs/biomechanics-laboratory/). During my master's, my interests shifted towards the engineering side that eventually drove me to pursue a PhD in biomedical engineering at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://wp.wpi.edu/MBL/).

I am currently a 4th year postdoc at [Northern Arizona University](https://biomech.nau.edu/). I have applied for multiple NIH grants and was recently awarded the [F32 Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/fellowships/F32).

Since very early on, I know I want a career in academia. Despite moments of self-doubt, it's been a fun ride so far.



### Rock Climbing
For me, rock climbing is an element that balances my (sometimes overwhelming) academic life, a way to know myself and push my limits, and a medium to connect with nature and friends.

I have been following climbing research and training to improve my own climbing. One day, I hope to link this hobby with my profession!
