My name is Ying Fang. I grew up in Wuhu, China, and have spent the last 10ish years in the United States. I am currently a postdoc at Northern Arizona University. This website is for sharing my academic and personal experiences, which include:

- Research in Biomechanics, engineering, and health science
- Thoughts on being in academics
- Part-time passion: rock climbing!


### Research

My research has always been around Biomechanics. There are many sub-fields within Biomechanics, such as how to build an artificial ligament that mimics biological tissue, how an owl fly silently, etc. What I focus on is to understand how people move, and change how people move to improve performance and prevent injuries.
