## Background

People with SCI have weakened bones due to the lack of mechanical stimulation that they used to receive during daily life prior to their injuries, and this exposes them to high fracture risk. Therefore, researchers have been trying either exercise or pharmaceutical interventions to address this issue.

During my PhD, I investigated one novel exercise intervention, functional electrical stimulation rowing (FES-rowing), to see whether it can help preventing bone loss in people with SCI. Half of our cohort also took Zoledronic Acid, a druge that inhibits bone resorption.

## Purpose

Determine whether 1-year FES-rowing with and without Zoledronic Acid could prevent bone loss in people with spinal cord injury (SCI).**


## Findings

1. FES-rowing alone has a neglectable effect on maintaining bone strength compared to FES-rowing combined with Zoledronic Acid.

2. The SCI user received much smaller knee loads during FES-rowing compared to the mechanical loads from daily activities (i.e.,walking).

## Future directions

Increasing joint loading in FES-rowing through optimized FES technology ergometer design may improve the osteogenic benefit of this rehabilitative exercise.
