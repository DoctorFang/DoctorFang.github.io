## Purpose

Determine whether 1-year functional electrical stimulation rowing (FES-rowing) with and without Zoledronic Acid could affect bone strength in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)

## Background

People with SCI have a high fracture risk at the knee. Therapies that prevent bone loss or stimulate a bone formation response have been proposed to reduce fractures.
During my PhD, I analyzed CT scans and developed finite element models to calculate bone strength of people who received FES-rowing training with and without Zoledronic Acid (a druge that inhibits bone resorption).
I also use musculoskeletal modeling to estimate joint loading during FES-rowing.

## Findings

1. FES-rowing alone has a neglectable effect on maintaining bone quality compared to FES-rowing combined with a drug that inhibits bone resorption.

2. SCI user received much smaller knee loads during FES-rowing compared to the knee loads people receive from daily activities such as walking.

## Future directions

Modify the FES technology or the design of the rowing machine to manipulate joint loading and potentially improve the osteogenic benefit of FES-rowing.
