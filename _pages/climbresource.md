## Common Injuries and Rehab
**Wrist**
- [Medial wrist pain/TFCC injury](https://theclimbingdoctor.com/tfcc-injury-a-common-source-of-wrist-pain-in-climbers/)


## Training and Injury Prevention
**Good Warm-ups**
- [Dynamic warmup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B86QxHCDiM0) : Helpful, fast, and does not require equipment.

- [Warmup routine from Esther Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-hs8b6vXOA) : Helpful and requires elastic band.

**Finger training**
- [The "no-hang" protocol](https://gripped.com/indoor-climbing/a-staggeringly-successful-new-hangboard-routine/) : Currently experimenting on myself.

- [Beginner finger training program](https://www.trainingbeta.com/beginner-finger-training-program/#:~:text=This%20program%20is%20for%20climbers,unique%20finger%20workouts%20every%20week) : Definitely felt stronger after the 5-week (took me 6 weeks) program. Things to keep in mind:
1. It's normal to have ups and downs;				
2. Be aware of short rests between sets; lengthen it if needed;				
3. Period makes a difference; PMS could cause muscle fatigue and joint pain;				
4. Ensure longer rest between training days if needed;				
5. Normal to feel weird or tired the next 1-2 days as long as there's no obvious acute event.		
		
**Injury prevention**
- [Injury prevention program](https://www.camp4humanperformance.com/blog-2/2021/12/16/c4hp-injury-prevention-program-ipp) : Currently experimenting on myself.

- [Tension block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUOm2IHylpA) : A safe way to rehab a finger injury.
