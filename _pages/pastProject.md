### FEW-Rowing and Bone Health in Spinal Cord Injury

People with SCI have a high fracture risk at the knee. Therapies that prevent bone loss or stimulate a bone formation response have been proposed to reduce fractures.
My dissertation project investigated one exercise intervention, FES-rowing, and its effect on bone strength and knee loading in people with SCI.
By analyzing computed tomography (CT) scans and developing finite element models, we found that FES-rowing alone has a neglectable effect on maintaining bone quality 
compared to FES-rowing combined with a drug that inhibits bone resorption.

A plausible explanation for the ineffectiveness of FES-rowing is that it does not provide sufficient mechanical loading to the user.
I confirmed this hypothesis by showing that the SCI user received much smaller knee loads during FES-rowing than the knee loads people receive from daily activities (unimpaired walking).
Furthermore, muscle force and rowing setups both determine the amount of joint loads. Future studies could modify the FES technology or ergometer design to improve the osteogenic benefit of FES-rowing.
